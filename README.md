## Introduction

After more than sixteen years in the oil and gas industry, I’m pursuing a professional transition into the field residential and commercial security installation of cybersecurity — a move driven by my passion for problem solving, systems thinking, and operational integrity. My experience in deepwater exploration and drilling optimization has sharpened my ability to analyze complex systems, identify vulnerabilities, and implement precise, policy-driven solutions under pressure.

Throughout my career, I’ve developed and enforced technical documentation, operational procedures, and safety policies that mirror the structure and discipline of cybersecurity frameworks. I’ve led audits, written after-action reports, and conducted root cause analyses — all requiring critical thinking, attention to detail, and data-driven decision making.

This foundation of analytical rigor, process compliance, and situational awareness now fuels my shift toward protecting digital assets with the same vigilance once applied to physical operations. My goal is to leverage my background in risk assessment and procedural excellence to strengthen security posture, support incident response, and contribute to a culture of cyber resilience.

## Objective

To transition from a career in oil and gas operations into the cybersecurity field, leveraging over sixteen years of experience in high-risk, data-driven environments. I aim to apply my expertise in problem solving, documentation, policy development, audits, and critical thinking to protect organizational assets, ensure compliance, and strengthen security frameworks. My goal is to contribute to a cybersecurity team where analytical precision, procedural discipline, and proactive risk management are essential to mission success.
